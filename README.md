## ✨ Features

* **Modern UI:** Clean, minimalist design with rounded corners and soft box-shadows.
* **Hover Effect:** A subtle `transform` and `box-shadow` transition provides professional user feedback.
* **Responsive:** The card is fully responsive and will adapt to any screen size, shrinking to fit mobile viewport.
* **Flexbox Layout:** The card content is structured using **CSS Flexbox**, allowing the description to grow and pushing the price and button to the bottom for a clean, aligned look regardless of text length.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts & Skills Demonstrated

This project is a strong portfolio piece for an internship or junior role because it demonstrates:

* **Semantic HTML:** Clean and logical structure for product information.
* **Advanced CSS Styling:** Use of `box-shadow`, `border-radius`, and `overflow: hidden` to create a modern card aesthetic.
* **CSS Flexbox:** Expert use of `display: flex`, `flex-direction: column`, and `flex-grow: 1` to build a robust and flexible content layout that adapts to varying text lengths.
* **Responsive Design:** Using a `max-width` and `width: 100%` approach to ensure the component looks great on all devices without complex media queries.
* **CSS Transitions:** Smooth hover animations for a better user experience (UX).
